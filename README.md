Grid Mixer
==========

Note: This project is currently in the early testing and development phases.  At best, it's a proof of concept. 

The goal of GridMixer is to develop a fun, interactive game that also educates players on some of the basic principals of modern electric grid integration and renewable energy.

The **Dezine** folder contains common documents and elements used in the creation of final assets (PSDs for example) and will not be deployed with the rest of the code.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

In order to make this thing work, you'll need to create a symlink from one of the localSettings.php.*whatever* files to **localSettings.php**:

```
ln -s localSettings.php.localdev localSettings.php
```
