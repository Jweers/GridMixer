real time supply and demand, including RE breakdown

"Spending Points"
- Buy auto-rampers to help you on a tough level
- Buy new RE tech like battery backups, etc.
- Mandatory spending, like supporting new residents.
  "10,000 new resident's moved in, what will you build?"
    - installation "cost" vs. fuel "cost"?
    or RE portfolio standards, i.e. you _must_ add 11% RE.

Possible Levels:
  (levels could add complexity by altering demand or supply, then both)
  Demand issues:
    Aluminum smelter
    Hot day (A/C load high)
    Cold day (heating load high)
    Data center
    The Big Game
  Supply levels:
    Arizona Desert (high variance between solar in day and wind at night)
    Afternoon thunderstorm (drastic drop in solar, erratic wind)
    Scheduled maintenance (takes a coal plant down to 50% capacity)

Track total pollutant level (in metric Tonnes)

Should be able to pick their city (for size/demand, generating mix pulled from state).

Level selector is the US map.  Pick interconnect, then migrate through cities and face different challenges in level mode.  Bonus: play your home town?

4/28/14 (Email from Austin):
  Use "weighted median" city (greater metro area) with population of 76k people, instead of actual median city of 1,000 people.
  * City would be Kennewick, Washington or Deerfield, Florida, both with 76k people.
    - Would need 220 MW or power (less than 1 coal plant)
    - Using general rule that US Capacity factor is ~0.5
  * Can use "fractions of a grid" or (probably better) would be to play a particular "area" consisting of actual plant loads and 3 or 4 cities.
  * if we do a city with 76k people, it could have 220 MW of generation which should generate about 2.7 GWh / day on average. If you use a demand curve that is qualitatively similar to the Cali curve and the area under the curve is 2.7 GWh, that should make a realistic (though still rough) demo training level.
